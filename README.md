# 🎬 Movies Data Analysis Project

## 📊 Overview

This project presents a comprehensive data analysis of a movies dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and insights within the film industry. Using Python and popular data analysis libraries such as **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**, we explore various aspects of movie performance including budget, revenue, popularity, and critical reception.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used contains information about thousands of movies including:

* Title
* Genre
* Budget
* Revenue
* Runtime
* Popularity
* Release Date
* Ratings (Vote Average & Vote Count)

---

## 🔍 Key Objectives

* Understand the structure and contents of the movie dataset.
* Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
* Analyze trends in movie production over time.
* Identify the most successful genres, directors, and actors.
* Explore correlations between budget, revenue, popularity, and ratings.
* Visualize findings through informative charts and graphs.

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

* **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
* **Pandas** – Data manipulation
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
* **Numpy** – Numerical operations

---

## 📈 Key Insights

* The number of movies released has increased over time.
* Certain genres, like Action and Adventure, tend to have higher revenues.
* There is a strong positive correlation between budget and revenue.
* Popularity is not always correlated with high vote average or revenue.

## 🧼 Data Cleaning

The data was cleaned by:

* Handling missing values.
* Removing duplicates.
* Converting data types.
* Extracting useful columns (e.g., extracting year from release date).

## 📌 Conclusion

This project showcases how data science techniques can provide valuable insights into industry trends, consumer preferences, and production strategies in the film industry. The analysis not only helps in understanding the past but can also guide future decisions in movie production and marketing.
